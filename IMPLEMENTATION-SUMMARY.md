### 5. **Micro-Interactions Implemented**

| Element | Interactions Added |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Buttons** | Ripple, Magnetic hover, Glow, Scale, Lift |
| **Cards** | 3D tilt, Hover lift, Shadow enhancement |
| **Images** | Scale, Rotate, Overlay effects |
| **Forms** | Focus lift, Border glow, Success animations |
| **Navigation** | Underline animation, Active states |
| **Text** | Gradient animation, Hover effects |
| **Logo** | Periodic pulse, Hover scale and rotate |
| **Social Icons** | Rotation, Background pulse, Lift |

### 6. **Performance Optimizations**

✅ **Hardware Acceleration**
- Using `transform` and `opacity` for animations
- GPU-accelerated properties only

✅ **Responsive Loading**
- Desktop: Full animations + parallax + particles
- Tablet: Reduced animations, no custom cursor
- Mobile: Essential animations only

✅ **Event Optimization**
- Debounced scroll handlers
- Throttled resize handlers
- Efficient event delegation
- Proper cleanup of event listeners

✅ **Smart Loading**
- Conditional feature loading based on device
- Lazy initialization of heavy features
- Viewport-based animation triggers

### 7. **Browser Compatibility**

| Browser | Support Level | Notes |
|---------|--------------|-------|
| Chrome/Edge | ✅ Full | All features work perfectly |
| Firefox | ✅ Full | All animations supported |
| Safari | ✅ Full | Webkit prefixes included |
| Mobile Safari | ✅ Optimized | Reduced animations |
| Chrome Mobile | ✅ Optimized | Reduced animations |

### 8. **Accessibility Considerations**

✅ **Motion Safety**
- Animations are not too fast or flashy
- No rapid flashing that could trigger seizures
- Smooth, predictable movements

✅ **Keyboard Navigation**
- All interactive elements remain accessible
- Focus states are enhanced, not removed
- Tab order is maintained

✅ **Screen Reader Compatibility**
- Animation classes don't interfere with content
- Semantic HTML structure preserved
- ARIA labels maintained
